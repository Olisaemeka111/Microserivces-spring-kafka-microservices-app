# Google Container Registry (GCR) Setup Instructions

## 1. Enable Container Registry API (Already Done)
You've already enabled the Container Registry API, which is great!

## 2. Grant Required Permissions to Service Account
Your service account needs additional permissions to push to GCR. Here's how to add them:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Navigate to IAM & Admin > IAM
3. Find your service account (github-actions@spring-kafka-microservices.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
4. Click the pencil icon to edit permissions
5. Click "ADD ANOTHER ROLE"
6. Add the following roles:
   - Storage Admin (roles/storage.admin)
   - Artifact Registry Writer (roles/artifactregistry.writer)
   - Artifact Registry Repository Administrator (roles/artifactregistry.admin)
7. Click "Save"

## 3. Create a GCR Repository (Optional)
You can pre-create the GCR repository to avoid the "createOnPush" permission issue:

1. Go to Artifact Registry > Repositories
2. Click "CREATE REPOSITORY"
3. Name: "spring-kafka-microservices"
4. Format: Docker
5. Mode: Standard
6. Location type: Region
7. Region: us-central1 (same as your GKE cluster)
8. Click "CREATE"

## 4. Alternative: Use Artifact Registry Instead
Google recommends using Artifact Registry instead of Container Registry. To switch:

1. Update the workflow file to use Artifact Registry instead of GCR:
   - Change `REGISTRY: gcr.io` to `REGISTRY: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev`
   - Update Docker build/push commands to use:
     `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/spring-kafka-microservices/${{ env.ORDER_SERVICE_IMAGE }}:${{ github.sha }}`

## 5. Run the Workflow Again
After making these changes, run the workflow again to see if the issue is resolved.
