# Instructions for Creating a New GCP Service Account Key

## Option 1: Using Google Cloud SDK CLI

```bash
# Make sure you're using the correct account
gcloud auth list

# Set the active account if needed
gcloud config set account olissa.arinze1@gmail.com

# Set the project
gcloud config set project spring-kafka-microservices

# Create a new service account key
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create github-actions-key-new.json \
  --iam-account=github-actions@spring-kafka-microservices.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Verify the key was created
cat github-actions-key-new.json
```

The new key file will be created in your current directory as `github-actions-key-new.json`.

## Option 2: Using Google Cloud Console
1. Open https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Make sure you're in the "spring-kafka-microservices" project
3. Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
4. Find the "github-actions@spring-kafka-microservices.iam.gserviceaccount.com" service account
5. Click on the three dots (actions menu) and select "Manage keys"
6. Click "ADD KEY" > "Create new key"
7. Choose JSON as the key type
8. Click "CREATE"
9. The key file will be automatically downloaded to your computer

## Step 3: Update the GitHub Secret
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
3. Edit the "GCP_SA_KEY" secret
4. Delete the current value
5. Copy the ENTIRE content of the newly downloaded JSON key file
6. Paste it as the new value for the "GCP_SA_KEY" secret
7. Click "Update secret"

## Step 4: Run the Workflow Again
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select the "GCP Authentication Test" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

## Additional Troubleshooting Steps
If you still encounter issues, check that:
1. The service account has the necessary permissions:
   - Kubernetes Engine Admin
   - Storage Admin
   - Container Registry Service Agent
2. The service account is active and not disabled
3. The JSON key is properly formatted in the GitHub secret (no extra spaces or line breaks)
