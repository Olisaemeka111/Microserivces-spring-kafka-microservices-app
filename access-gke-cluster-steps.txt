# Steps to Access Your GKE Cluster

## 1. Find Google Cloud SDK Installation Path
First, locate where Google Cloud SDK is installed on your system. Common locations:
- C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Cloud SDK\
- C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Cloud SDK\

## 2. Add Google Cloud SDK to PATH
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
# Add Google Cloud SDK to your PATH (adjust the path if needed)
$cloudSdkPath = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Cloud SDK\google-cloud-sdk\bin"
$env:PATH += ";$cloudSdkPath"

# Verify gcloud is accessible
gcloud --version
```

## 3. Set GKE Auth Plugin Environment Variable

```powershell
# Set the environment variable for GKE auth plugin
$env:USE_GKE_GCLOUD_AUTH_PLUGIN = "True"
```

## 4. Get GKE Cluster Credentials

```powershell
# Get credentials for your GKE cluster
gcloud container clusters get-credentials spring-kafka-cluster --zone us-central1 --project spring-kafka-microservices
```

## 5. Verify Cluster Access

```powershell
# Check if you can access the cluster
kubectl get nodes
```

## 6. Alternative: Access via Google Cloud Console

If you continue to have issues with local access, you can use the Google Cloud Console:

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Navigate to Kubernetes Engine > Clusters
3. Find your cluster (spring-kafka-cluster)
4. Click "Connect" and then "Run in Cloud Shell"
5. This will open a Cloud Shell session with access to your cluster
6. From there, you can run kubectl commands to deploy monitoring and logging

## 7. Deploy via GitHub Actions

Another option is to deploy monitoring and logging through GitHub Actions:

1. Copy the monitoring-logging-workflow.yaml file to .github/workflows/
2. Push the changes to your repository
3. The workflow will authenticate and deploy the components for you
