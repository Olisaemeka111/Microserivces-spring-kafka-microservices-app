# How to Trigger the GitHub Actions Workflow

# Option 1: Manually trigger the workflow from GitHub UI
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Olisaemeka111/Microserivces-spring-kafka-microservices-app
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Select "Deploy Optimized Resources to GKE" workflow
4. Click on "Run workflow" button (dropdown on the right)
5. Select the main branch
6. Click "Run workflow"

# Option 2: Make a small change to a Kubernetes file to trigger the workflow automatically
# You can run these commands in your local repository:

# Make a small comment change to infrastructure.yaml
echo "# Triggered deployment $(date)" >> k8s/infrastructure.yaml
git add k8s/infrastructure.yaml
git commit -m "Trigger deployment workflow"
git push origin main

# The workflow will automatically start when the push is detected
